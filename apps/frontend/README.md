# Getting Started

We recommend using [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/). First, install all dependencies:

```bash
pnpm install
```

Then, run the development server:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

To build for production:

```bash
pnpm build
```

To serve the production-ready build:

```bash
pnpm start
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to see the result.
