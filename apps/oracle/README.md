# Custom Development Oracle

This is a custom-implemented oracle used in the early stages of development. The service is currently not in use, but remains as a historical artifact.

To run it, you need to provide the following environment variables:
- `RPC`
- `SECRET`
- `ORACLE_ADDRESS`

Then, simply run:
```bash
cargo run
```
