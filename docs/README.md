# Introduction

Sway Lend is a decentralized lending platform that operates on the [Fuel Network](https://fuel.network), which has an Ethereum consensus layer. Our platform provides a secure and trustful place for crypto users to earn passive income by supplying liquidity to the market.

With Sway Lend, users can supply up to 6 different crypto assets as collateral and borrow USDC, the base asset. Suppliers earn a passive income by providing liquidity, while borrowers have the option to borrow in either an overcollateralized (perpetually) or undercollateralized manner. \
\
The Sway Lend protocol is built on a re-engineered solution from the Ethereum blockchain, rewritten in the Sway programming language. Our platform is a re-imagining of the [Compound](https://compound.finance/) architecture offers all the features and benefits of the [Compound](https://compound.finance/) with the added security and stability of the [Fuel Network.](https://fuel.network) Our platform is constantly monitored and improved by our dedicated team, who are always available to answer any questions or provide support.
